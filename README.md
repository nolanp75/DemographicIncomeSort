How to Run

Make sure CMake is installed and working before building. Open the project folder in VS Code and build it using CMake. The compiled files will appear in the cmake-build-debug folder.

Run the main executable from that folder. When the program asks for filters, type them separated by commas. Then choose whether to use QuickSort or HeapSort to sort the data.

After the program finishes, the sorted CSV file will appear in the cmake-build-debug folder. The file will be named quicksorted_customers.csv if QuickSort was used or heapsorted_customers.csv if HeapSort was used.
